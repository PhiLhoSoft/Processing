ABOUT REV 0161 - 24 November 2008

Fourth pre-release for 1.0, with two code changes and the final disk
image for OS X, but still missing the final documentation.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Ignore dot files (.DS_Store), dot folders (.svn) with Export and
  Save As. These were causing trouble, especially with SVN.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=761

+ Present mode on OS X causing strange flicker/jump while window opens.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1051

[ changes ]

+ Final disk image artwork and new distribution setup for 1.0.

ABOUT REV 0160 - 24 November 2008

Third pre-release for 1.0, this is hopefully the last of the code
changes, though some distribution and documentation issues need
to be finished up.

[ changes ]

+ Add option to preferences to enable/disable removing the applet or
  application folder when exporting.

+ Set background color for present mode on Export to Application.

+ Set stop button color for Export to Application.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix placement of new editor windows to avoid overlap.

+ Stroked lines drawing on top of everything else in P3D
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1032

+ Placement of 100x100 sketches is incorrect.

ABOUT REV 0159 - 23 November 2008

Another pre-release for 1.0. This list is incomplete, and will be updated
for the next release.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Editor caret was not blinking.

+ The width of the export application on windows was incorrect on Windows.
  Improve export application window layout spacing on OS X. Also disable
  the stop button item when full screen not selected.

+ Error after creating more than 26 temporary sketches in one day.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1039

[ changes ]

+ Change how Present mode is handled. When run inside the PDE, only Mac OS X
  uses exclusive mode with Present. Windows and Linux just do full screen
  windows. When run outside the PDE, all three simply create an undecorated
  window the size of the entire screen, and on the Mac, an option is added
  to the Info.plist file to hide the dock and menubar (since that cannot be
  done programatically from Java).

+ Update to Java 6 update 10 for Linux and Windows.

+ Update Quaqua to release 5.0.1.

+ Add option to hide the stop button in Export to Application

+ Move the color settings out of the preferences.txt file, and into a
  single theme.txt file found inside lib/theme.

ABOUT REV 0158 - 22 November 2008

Pre-release for 1.0.

[ changes ]

+ New design for 1.0: new icons, toolbar, colors, etc.

+ Add Export to Application options dialog.

+ Confirm "Do you want to Quit?" and remove the preference for auto-quit.
  Was too confusing for users on OS X which would create multiple incrementing

+ Change sketch naming to spell out the current month. Makes it easier to
  read, and dropping the year because it's not necessary.

+ Linux and Windows now inlude Java 6 update 10 with the download.

+ All options related to theme (colors, images) are found in lib/theme.
  This lays the groundwork for a future effort to make the color scheme
  more customizable by users.

+ Bring back CENTER_RADIUS (for older code) but deprecate it.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1035

+ Enable 2x full-screen anti-aliasing by default with OpenGL.
  This can be disabled with hint(DISABLE_OPENGL_2X_SMOOTH), or you can
  enable 4x smoothing with hint(ENABLE_OPENGL_4X_SMOOTH).

[ bug fixes ]

+ Clean up some of the new/open code internally.

+ Implement error message regarding the Apple menu bug on Leopard.
  Add a preference to toggle the menubar on OS X.

+ Fix OS X dist script to run on Leopard.

+ beginShape(TRIANGLE_FAN), and therefore arc(), broken in P2D
  also a typo in the ColorWheel example
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1019

+ NullPointerException drawing line with alpha stroke (P2D)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1023

+ P2D endShape() is working like endShape(CLOSE)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1021
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1028

+ arc() center transparent with P2D and smooth()
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1027

+ Alpha stroke rendered at full opacity in P2D
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1024

+ Bring back the .width and .height fields for PShape

ABOUT REV 0157 - 18 November 2008

The return of P2D and a handful of bug fixes.

[ changes ]

+ P2D has returned for the first time since alpha (release 0069).
  It's probably not yet complete, please test and file bugs if you
  find things that are missing or not behaving correctly.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Show sketch folder failing for directories containing umlauts.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1010

+ Find in Reference does not open Firefox in 0156 for Linux.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1012

+ Fixed a problem where the default per-platform preference settings
  were not being set properly, resulting in sadness like ugly default
  fonts in the editor. You may want to remove your preferences.txt file
  to reset your settings if your afflicted by an ugly monospaced font
  in your editor.

+ SVG polygon shapes not drawing since loadShape() and PShape changes.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1005

+ image(img, x, y) was not honoring imageMode(CENTER), now fixed.

ABOUT REV 0154 - 21 October 2008

Read the release notes for revision 0149 (and for the others since that
release, for that matter.) There were major changes to library installation,
and the Candy and XML libraries have been moved.

[ fixes/changes ]

+ Clean up PATH for users who have garbage in the Windows PATH variable
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=974

+ Disable renaming of a sketch to the name of a file already in the sketch

+ Only set apple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz on osx, otherwise security error
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=976

+ Added skewX() and skewY() to PMatrix/2D/3D

+ Added support style attributes to SVG support, thanks Ricard Marxer Piñón
  for the implementation help.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=771

+ Remove setX/Y/Z methods from PVector (not needed with full access to the
  x, y, and z fields). Also removed copy() (use get() instead), and added
  mult() and div() methods that act on whole PVector objects.

+ Updated reference and examples for changes and new API.

[ known problems ]

+ Slow response on file/sketchbook/examples menus on OS X 10.5. This is
  an Apple bug in Java 1.5 and 1.6 on Mac OS X 10.5 causing these menus
  to be extremely slow. Some workarounds are described in the bug report:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786
  Please file a bug report with Apple if you want this fixed.
  The problem has existed since the spring, and we first filed a bug

ABOUT REV 0152 - 19 October 2008

Read the release notes for revision 0149! There were major changes to
library installation, and the Candy and XML libraries have been moved.

This release contains a bug fix, and now includes Damien Di Fede's
excellent Minim audio library as part of the download. (Thanks!)

I neglected to mention in the 0151 release notes that the polygon smoothing
work was brought back from the alpha releases by Eric Jordan who re-integrated
the code into the more recent source and added proper perspective correction
and smoothing for textures. Many thanks to ewjordan!

[ changes ]

+ Unlike Candy, you can no longer use shape.width and shape.height to get
  the dimensions of an object. To get the width and height of a PShape,
  use getWidth() and getHeight(). We neglected to include these in the
  PShape/loadShape reference. The reason for the change is that sometimes
  time-consuming calculations will be required to figure out the dimensions
  of a shape.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix video library breaking due to a fix for another video library bug.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=961
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=962
  The changes have been removed, so the original bug has been reopened:

ABOUT REV 0151 - 17 October 2008

Read the 0149 release notes! This release contains only additions and
a couple bug fixes.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix NullPointerException on curveVertex() when using more than 128 vertices
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=952

+ Fix text(x, y, w, h) once again. That text just won't stay in the box.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=954

+ Fix seams that show up at the edge of textures with OpenGL.

+ Fix problem where size(w, h) with an odd number for height will make
  blue line across image in saveFrame(). This also affected any other pixel
  operations in OpenGL, because it was breaking loadPixels().
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=944

+ Fix ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException showing up when drawing lines or points.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=246
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=462
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=937

[ changes / additions ]

+ Your childhood friend the smooth() command is returning to P3D. Right now
  internal lines of shapes may be visible when smoothing is enabled in P3D,
  but that will be fixed in a future release.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=957

+ Crazy old Uncle Strokeweight is also returning to P3D, however he still
  hasn't turned himself around and retains his old baggage:

  With P2D, P3D, and OPENGL, series of connected lines (such as the stroke
  around a polygon, triangle, or ellipse) produce unattractive results when
  strokeWeight is set.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=955

  When used with P3D, strokeWeight does not interpolate the Z-coordinates
  of the lines, which means that when rotated, these flat lines may
  disappear. (Since, uh, lines are, you know, flat.) The OPENGL renderer
  setting does not share this problem because it always draws lines
  perpendicular to the screen (which we hope to do in a future release).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=956

  The original strokeWeight() bug, which also contains a code
  example for those wanting to do their own thick line code:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=123

+ Removed the error dialog that popped up to nag about sketch naming,
  now we're only writing it to the console.

+ Library authors note that the dimensional() method in PGraphics has been
  split into is2D() and is3D() for better congruence with use.

[ cannot fix ]

+ Some file dialogs on Linux produce a stream of error chatter to the
  console. This has been identified as a Sun bug.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=951

[ regression ]

+ OpenGL rendering is more dim/darker in release 0149 and later.

ABOUT REV 0150 - 15 October 2008

Read the 0149 release notes! This release only includes two small tweaks.

[ bug fix ]

+ ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException after pressing Run with release 0149.
  Compile errors that weren't associated with a particular line number
  caused a strange error message to show up.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=949

[ change ]

+ Updated Java to release 1.6.0_07 on Windows and Linux. This doesn't
  mean you can use Java 5 or 6 syntax with the environment, but does
  help us with some random bugs in the older Java 5 releases (on Linux
  especially) and hopefully improves performance (on Windows especially).

ABOUT REV 0149 - 15 October 2008

Very large number of bug fixes and changes. All renderers that use
PGraphics will need to be updated for this release. That means you'll
need a new GLGraphics, P5Sunflow, etc. Lots of libraries will need to
be updated for 0149.

Important! library and tool folders have changed--see notes below.

This release also adds command-line support, which means that Processing
can be integrated into all manner of environments. More info below.

Also many, many updates to the examples and reference in this release.

* RELEASES SINCE 0135 CONTAIN MANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, PLEASE READ *
*  THE NOTES IN THIS FILE FOR ANY RELEASE THAT YOU'VE NOT YET USED. *

[ libraries & tools ]

+ Beginning with this release, all libraries should be placed in the sketchbook
  folder, inside a folder called "libraries". It's a bad idea to put them in
  the Processing libraries folder, because 1) users may not have access to that
  folder in lab environments, and 2) it's now hidden on OS X (see below).

+ Also in this release, all tools should be placed in a folder named "tools"
  inside your sketchbook folder. Same reasons as above.

[ launchers ]

+ The Mac OS X release is now a single .app file, simplifying the install and
  bringing us into closer Steve compliance.

+ The Windows release has a new launcher based on a hacked/tweaked version
  of launch4j-3.0.1, an excellent app bundling tool for Windows. Many thanks
  to its developer(s) for their hard work. http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/

+ Fixed a Windows problem with the JDK not being found, even when installed.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=878

+ Fixed a problem with older/badder JDKs being used on Windows.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=545

+ Made PDE files double-clickable on Windows.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=683
  By default we now set the registry associations to launch the most recently
  run version of processing.exe (it must be called that, at least for now)
  when a .pde file is double-clicked. The behavior can be disabled in the
  Preferences dialog.

+ With the new launcher, we even have a splash screen (the about box) that
  shows up while Java is roused from bed.

[ changes ]

+ Changed how PGraphics objects are created for better consistency. Sadly,
  this will require any libraries that subclass PGraphics to be rebuilt
  for this release. (However, internally it's a great improvement.)
  Renderer library authors please read the reference for PGraphics:
  http://dev.processing.org/reference/core/javadoc/processing/core/PGraphics.html
  For library developers, a gritty list of the internal function changes
  can be found in processing/core/done.txt in the revision 0149 section under
  the heading "PGraphics API changes". (It's not poetic, but it's real.)

+ We've decided that vector geometry is as important as image data, so the
  Candy library has been removed, and replaced by a built-in loadShape()
  method in PApplet, which returns a PShape object. (Candy lives on as the
  PShapeSVG class, which is the PShape subclass created by loadShape.)
  A shape() command has been added (like the image() command for images).
  See the new SVG examples for more information. In the future, we'd like
  to support other vector formats (such as OBJ) with loadShape(), or
  provide a means for libraries to register themselves to load shape data.

+ The PShape object is just a container for now, but will someday provide
  methods for accessing actual vertex information.

+ Because of the SVG changes, the XML library is now built into the core.
  This means that processing.xml will be imported by default (no need for
  "import processing.xml" in your sketch). This also means that "XML"
  will no longer be seen in the "Import Library" menu.

+ Altered how createInput(), save(), and saveFrame() work so that they
  are more friendly to signed applets.

+ Implemented new error/warning system inside PGraphics so that errors
  are only shown once, and non-fatal errors do not shut down the sketch.

+ The unhint() method has been removed, see the hint() reference for changes.

+ Changed how match() works to bring back in line with other regexp
  implementations. Instead of only returning matching groups, match 0
  is the matching sequence, and array elements [1] and higher represent
  each of the groups (sequences found in parens). This brings us into
  compliance with how "everyone else" does it. Please direct complaints,
  jeers, or accolades to Dan Shiffman, who advocated the change.

+ Also starting in this release, the match() commands use multiline
  matching (Pattern.MULTILINE) and dotall mode (Pattern.DOTALL) by default
  so that ^ and $ match the beginning and end of any lines found in the
  source, and the . operator will also pick up newline characters.

+ The arraycopy() method is now arrayCopy(), for better consistency with
  the rest of the API (think framerate vs. frameRate). Because books have
  been printed with the lowercase version, we're keeping both, but in
  Java parlance, we've deprecated the lowercase version.

+ Removed MACOS9 constant from processing.core.PConstants. Bye bye 2001.

+ Deprecated the NORMALIZED constant, use NORMAL instead.

+ Removed some items from the default imports because they're 1) likely
  to cause naming collisions and 2) more likely to be used by advanced
  users (who can add 'em themselves anyway). The removed items include:
  javax.sound.midi,javax.sound.midi.spi,
  javax.sound.sampled,javax.sound.sampled.spi,
  javax.xml.parsers,javax.xml.transform,javax.xml.transform.dom,
  javax.xml.transform.sax,javax.xml.transform.stream,
  org.xml.sax,org.xml.sax.ext,org.xml.sax.helpers
  You can add default imports to your preferences.txt file by adding to
  the preproc.imports line. But keep in mind that this will make your
  code incompatible with Processing on any machine that doesn't have
  its preferences.txt mangled in the same manner.

+ Update Quaqua to 4.4.7 on Mac OS X (http://www.randelshofer.ch/quaqua/)

+ Disable abyssmally slow Sun renderer on OS X 10.5, by setting
  apple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz to true inside PApplet.main().

+ Removed /System/Library/Java from the CLASSPATH in the Processing.app
  Info.plist file on Mac OS X. This disables the com.apple.* classes,
  but those are mostly deprecated anyway.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1045

[ bug fixes ]

+ Prevent caps/joins from throwing an error and halting the render.
  This was a problem when drawing SVG files with OpenGL:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=628
  However, complex shapes or shapes with holes will produce an error in OpenGL:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=947

+ The point() command should now work always and consistently
  in OpenGL as well as Java 2D.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=121

+ Fix GLDrawableFactory.chooseGraphicsConfiguration() error with OpenGL
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=891
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=908

+ Fix problem with error line highlighting (wrong line being highlighted)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=888

+ Make error messages clear the message area.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=912

+ "IllegalMonitorStateException: current thread not owner" with delay()
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=894

+ PVector is a simple 3-dimensional vector (x, y, z) or point class,
  based on code from Dan Shiffman. No more roll-your-own vectorishness.

+ PMatrix interface, along with PMatrix2D (3x2 affine) and PMatrix3D (4x4)
  implementations for use with the renderers (and your own code).

+ Added matchAll() method, which is identical to match(), except that
  it returns an array of all matches in the specified String, rather
  than just the first. (Thanks to Dan Shiffman for the implementation.)

+ Add new "Getting Started" to the help menu
  http://processing.org/learning/gettingstarted/
  The old Getting Started item has been renamed to "Environment".

+ Added getImage() method to PImage, which returns it as a java.awt.Image.
  (Actually it's a BufferedImage, but who's keeping track?)

+ Added a note to prefs dialog that multiple jar export only works w/o libs

+ Slow response on file/sketchbook/examples menus on OS X 10.5. This is
  an Apple bug in Java 1.5 and 1.6 on Mac OS X 10.5 causing these menus
  to be extremely slow. With Apple's Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 7,
  they appear to have successfully backported the bug to OS X 10.4.

ABOUT REV 0148 - 19 August 2008

* RELEASES SINCE 0135 CONTAIN MANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, PLEASE READ *
*  THE NOTES IN THIS FILE FOR ANY RELEASE THAT YOU'VE NOT YET USED. *

This release contains fixes for compatability with the GLGraphics
library and documentation about the Tools menu.

With any luck, this will be the last release for at least a week.

[ changes ]

+ Some additions have been made to the internal API to support the
  GLGraphics library, which is incompatible with the last few releases.
  You'll still need to download a new version of the library that's
  compatible with this release (0148) of Processing.

+ Cleaned up internal API for proper interfaces with user-contributed
  items for the Tools menu.

+ A "tools" folder has been added, which includes a howto.txt file that
  explains how to build your own tools. Note that like libraries,
  contributed tools should be stored in the sketchbook. (See the
  howto.txt files in "libraries" and "tools" for more information.)

+ An example Tool with source and a build script is included. (However
  it's not compiled by default, so you won't see it in the menu.)
  Future releases may put all items from the Tools menu into the
  default "tools" folder with source (just like the libraries).

[ known problems ]

+ Slow response on file/sketchbook/examples menus on OS X 10.5.
  This is an Apple bug in Java 1.5 and 1.6 on Mac OS X 10.5

  Workarounds described in the bug report:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786
  Please file a bug report with Apple if you want this fixed!

+ In the current Windows release, Processing may not be able to find
  the JDK even if you have one installed. If this happens on your machine,
  copy the contents of your JDK installation to a new folder titled "java"
  inside the Processing folder. This fill be fixed in a future release.

*  THE NOTES IN THIS FILE FOR ANY RELEASE THAT YOU'VE NOT YET USED. *

Fix for OpenGL export problem introduced in recent releases. Also an
implementation for the "Tools" menu, and lots of internal code cleanup.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Fixed broken OpenGL export since release 0145.

+ Not yet confirmed as fixed, but potentially fixed a problem where
  applets would not restart after switching pages in a web browser.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=581

+ Fix a problem with the Linux release not running sketches when
  'java' was not already in the PATH.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=879

[ changes ]

+ The "Tools" menu can now handle user-contributed code for tools
  that extend the Processing Development Environment in some fashion.
  This will be documented further in the next few days, for now,
  try to contain your excitement about upcoming contributions like
  "Color Selector 2.0", "ROT13 Code Mangler", and "I Am Rich".
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=124

+ To make way for the Tools menu, lots of code had to be cleaned
  up inside the Editor and Sketch classes. Keep an eye out for problems
  with Save, Save As, Rename, Delete, and others. If something strange
  happens, *please file a bug immediately* so that we can get it fixed.
  We take sketch-destroying bugs very seriously. Please test!

Bug fixes, regression repair, and fun features.

* RELEASES SINCE 0135 CONTAIN MANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, PLEASE READ *
*  THE NOTES IN THIS FILE FOR ANY RELEASE THAT YOU'VE NOT YET USED. *

[ bug fixes ]

+ get() and set() sometimes not honoring imageMode() setting with
  the JAVA2D renderer setting.

+ Fix problem with comment/uncomment and indent/outdent in cases
  where no selection is active.

+ When un-commenting lines, first ensure that *all* the lines are
  commented out, otherwise default to adding comment markers to them.

+ Fix (semi-major) regression in 145 (as compared to 0144) where exception
  lines were not highlighting properly.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=877

+ Improve exception error messages (regression since 0135) by including
  their full message rather than just their type.

+ Fix problem with 3D geometry drawing multiple times in P3D.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=737

[ changes ]

+ Added imageMode(CENTER). Or rather, brought it back from the 0070s.

+ Greatly improve exception handling and parsing through the use of a
  proper implementation and the removal of a large amount of duct tape.

+ Fix and finalize previously unannounced, unmentioned (untouchable)
  functions that prompt the user for a file to open, a location to save
  a file, or select a folder. The functions each return a String object
  (or null for no selection) and are called selectInput(), selectOutput(),
  and selectFolder(). No parameters are necessary, but an optional
  parameter allows you to specify the user prompt. For instance:
  String loadPath = selectInput("What file ya want?");
  String savePath = selectOutput("Save this masterpiece as...");
  String folderPath = selectFolder("Which folder has the good stuff?");

+ Use actual sketch name when running instead of Temporary_NNNN_NNNN.

+ Make the Processing icon show up in external windows (Windows and Linux).
  Also set the window title (and dock title on OS X) for sketches.

ABOUT REV 0145 - 15 August 2008

This release contains several changes to fix issues related to timing
in sketches. The animation loop has been tuned and several bugs have
been ironed out.

* RECENT RELEASES CONTAIN MANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, PLEASE READ THE *
*    NOTES IN THIS FILE FOR ANY RELEASE THAT YOU'VE NOT YET USED.   *

[ known problems ]

+ Slow response on file/sketchbook/examples menus on OS X 10.5.
  This is an Apple bug in Java 1.5 and 1.6 on Mac OS X 10.5
  (but not 10.4) causing these menus to be extremely slow.
  Workarounds described in the bug report:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786
  If you find this annoying, please file a bug at bugreporter.apple.com.

+ Intermittent problem where sketches will not start when the Run
  button is pressed some fraction of the time. On a single try,
  it may not work, but subsequent clicks to the Run button will bring
  things back.. So far, this is limited to Mac OS X, but it's
  known to be a threading issue, and is likely to show up elsewhere.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=852

+ This release will be incompatible with other libraries that create
  their own PGraphics objects, such as the current release (0.8.1)
  of Andres Colubri's GLGraphics library. (Though by the time you read
  this, it may be updated.)

+ There are many other known problems, these are only a few that you're
  likely to run into because they have appeared in recent releases.

[ changes ]

+ Now using JOGL 1.1.1 instead of 1.0. This should bring us out of the
  dark ages for JOGL, but may require some people to upgrade the drivers
  on their graphics cards.

+ Don't say I didn't warn ya: loadImageAsync() is now requestImage(),
  which is its final naming. Documentation has not yet been added,
  but will be added soon. For syntax, see the notes for 0144 (below).

+ Added sphereDetail(u, v) function contributed by davbol (Thanks Dave!)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=856

+ Implemented textAlign() for y coordinates with text(str, x, y, w, h)

+ textAlign(BOTTOM) now takes textDescent() into account.

+ Fix indentation problems in "Copy for Discourse" by inserting unicode
  non-breaking space characters (\u00A0) at the beginning of lines.
  This works on many (Internet Explorer, Safari) but not all (Firefox
  and Camino on Mac OS X) browsers.

ABOUT REV 0144 - 9 August 2008

This is the first default download since release 0135. It represents
several significant changes, so PLEASE READ ALL THE INFO BELOW FOR
REVISIONS 0136 through 0143 if this is the first version you're using
since 0135. We've also tried to update the documentation on
processing.org, however with the number of things that have changed,
some things might be missed.

[ changes ]

+ Updated reference and examples.

+ Unlike release 0135 and earlier, a full JDK (not just a JRE) is
  required. I've added a test to see whether a proper JDK is installed.
  If not, it presents an error message and berates you for not heeding
  the repeated warnings to actually read this document. It also
  permanently disables your privileges for downloading the "expert"
  release of Processing that doesn't include Java.

+ Added loadImageAsync(filename) and loadImageAsync(filename, ext).
  These functions load images on a separate thread so that your
  sketch does not freeze while images load during setup(). While the
  image is loading, its width and height will be 0. If an error
  occurs while loading the image, its width and height will be set
  to -1. You'll know when the image has loaded properly because its
  width and height will be > 0.

  Asynchronous image loading (particularly when downloading from a
  server) drastically improves performance. In my case it was a 2-3x
  speedup when downloading 20 JPEG files that were ~3 MB apiece.

  An example of loading a single image in the background:

  PImage bigImage;

  void setup() {
    bigImage = loadImageAsync("something.jpg");
  }

  void draw() {
    if (bigImage.width == 0) {
      // image is not yet loaded
    } else if (bigImage.width == -1) {
      // this means an error occurred during image loading
    } else {
      // image is ready to go, draw it
      image(bigImage, 0, 0);
    }
  }

  These functions do not yet have proper documentation, and their
  name is very likely to change in a future release before 1.0.
  I'm announcing them because some people will find them useful,
  just keep an eye on revisions.txt for name changes.

+ Fixed a problem where OutOfMemoryErrors (as well as other more
  catastrophic/complicated errors like StackOverflowError) were not
  reported. These are now reported along with additional explanation
  in the editor console.

+ Better error messages for OpenGL quirks.

+ Improve efficiency of directionalLight and pointLight with OpenGL.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1199376364

+ Incorporate changes to better support Andres Colubri's improved
  OpenGL graphics library.

+ Slight modification to name handling in the XML library. This makes
  existing code behave closer to the older XML library found in 0135.
  For those using 0136+, getFullName() has been changed to getName(),
  and getName() to getLocalName().

+ Added indent/outdent feature to the Edit menu. Also updated the
  right-click context menu for the editor to incorporate more of the
  recent additions to the Edit menu.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=840
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=841

[ bug fixes ]

+ Don't open more than one copy of the Preferences window.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=830

+ Fixed a problem where bad image data would make image loading fail
  without an error message. The only indication of it breaking was
  that the width and height of the image would be -1. The latter is
  still the case, but an error message is printed to the console.

[ known problems ]

+ "Use textFont() before text" message (see the link for fixes)

ABOUT REV 0143 - 28 July 2008

Now using ECJ (the Eclipse Compiler for Java) instead of Javac. The
Eclipse compiler is more easily pluggable in the more basic ways
that we'd like to use it. Also moving toward removing the requirement
(since release 0136+) for a full JDK.

** IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST RELEASE SINCE 0135, PLEASE READ THE "ABOUT" **
**  ENTRIES FOR 0136 TO 0142 BELOW FOR MAJOR CHANGES AND KNOWN BUGS  **

  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=851
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=842

+ Giving up on Apple ever fixing their font specification bug,
  and just built in a workaround so that fonts are more likely to
  work on Mac OS X. With the workaround, using createFont() in code
  (on OS X) may cause a lag (on my machine it's 150 ms with 800 fonts)
  or in some cases when using hint(ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=407
  Filed as bug #4769141 with Apple http://bugreport.apple.com/

+ Properly handle negative values passed to the arc() command.

[ changes ]

+ Add a resize(int width, int height) method to PImage.
  Not yet documented in the reference, but allows you to resize
  a PImage in place. Setting width or height to zero will resize
  that dimension in proportion to the other.

[ cannot fix ]

+ Slow response on file/sketchbook/examples menus on OS X 10.5.

ABOUT REV 0142 - 16 June 2008

A couple minor changes from 0141, though they have a big impact on
reducing the "cannot parse error message" text from the compiler.
Please read the "about" notes from 0136 through 0141 before using
this release.

[ fixes/changes ]

+ Fixed "cannot parse error text" for many, many situations.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=820

+ Fixed a problem with errors that are at the end of the code.
  For instance, a missing } put the error /after/ the code,
  which itself produced another error.

+ Web colors with more or less than 6 chars produced bizarre error.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=196

+ Update iText in PDF library to 2.1.2u, in a failed attempt to fix
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=727

+ loadStrings(".") no longer lists directory contents.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=716

[ not yet fixed ]

+ "Target VM failed to initialize: VM initialization failed" on run
  This happens because Java is not properly getting the machine's
  internet address. Workaround is to shut off networking:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=796

+ Slow response on file/sketchbook/examples menus on OS X 10.5.
  There appears to be an Apple bug in Java 1.5 and 1.6 on
  Mac OS X 10.5 (but not 10.4) causing these menus to be extremely

ABOUT REV 0141 - 11 June 2008

This release fixes some issues found in the previous release,
and changes to UTF-8 encoding when loading and saving sketches.
The latter is a major change, please read below.

While this release should be more stable than 0140, releases since
0135 may be closer to alpha quality. If this is your first release
since 0135, ** please read all the release notes below ** as there
have been many changes, and there are a handful of known bugs.

[ utf8 encoding ]

+ For better internationalization support, we've changed to UTF-8
  encoding when loading and saving sketches.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=743

+ Sketches that contain non-ASCII characters and were saved
  with Processing 0140 and earlier may look strange when opened.
  Garbled text and odd characters may appear where umlauts,
  cedillas, and Japanese formerly lived. If this happens,
  use the "Fix Encoding & Reload" option under the Tools menu.
  This will reload your sketch using the same method as previous
  versions of Processing, at which point you can re-save it
  which will write a proper UTF-8 version.

+ Once you've converted a sketch to UTF-8, it will look similarly
  garbled if you use a release of Processing earlier than 0141.

[ fixes and changes ]

+ Hiding some unncessary warnings when compiling since they looked
  too much like errors. For instance, "xxxx uses unsafe operations",
  and "recompile with -Xlint:xxxx".
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=817

+ Fix getChild() and getChildren() to properly handle namespaces
  in the XML library.

ABOUT REV 0140 - 10 June 2008

Major changes (some might say improvements) to compilation and
platform-specific support. As with all releases later than 0135,
this is essentially an alpha-quality release. We won't be making
them the default download until the series stabilizes. Please help
us out by testing this releases, and filing bugs in the bugs
database if you run into problems.

If this is your first release since 0135, be sure to read *ALL*
the releases notes in this file since that release. A lot has
changed, and there are several known issues.

[ jikes/javac ]

+ Jikes has been removed, and we are using Javac as the compiler.
  The negative side of this is that compilation is a little slower,
  because Javac is kind of a dog. But that's outweighed by:
  - better compatability (avoiding quirky Jikes bugs)
  - ability to support Java 1.5 syntax (only in tabs that end in .java!)
  - no more Jikes binary problems on Linux (or elsewhere)
  - removing a binary from the download (less moving parts)

+ Error messages from Javac are very different, and it's quite
  likely that some aren't being handled properly. If you run into
  this situation (on error messages--not warnings), please file
  a bug report, so that we can provide a better message to the
  user about what's going on.

+ It is still not possible to use Java 1.5 syntax in Processing code
  from within the environment. You won't be able to use 1.5 syntax
  until someone rewrites the preprocessor, which is a significant
  undertaking. We want to do it soon, but it's a lot of work.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=598
  What has changed in release 0140 is that if you give a tab a name
  ending in ".java", you'll be able to use 1.5 syntax, because that
  tab will not be run through the preprocessor. However, you'll also
  lose all Processing-specific syntax, and you'll have to pass the
  PApplet object to any such class in order to use Processing API.
  (This is described in Help -> Getting Started.) And no, you cannot
  make the main tab a .java file. You can always use Eclipse to do
  that, or better yet, give us a hand fixing Bug #598.

[ platform classes ]

+ Platform-specific code has been moved to separate sections of the
  codebase. This simplifies how we connect to Mac OS X, Windows,
  and Linux. You no longer need the Apple support stubs to compile on
  Windows and Linux, for one.

+ Windows registry calls are now handled using JNA, which is behaving
  far better than the old JNI Registry code that we had been using.
  This should also help internationalization significantly (the old
  code didn't properly handle Unicode, or multi-byte characters).

+ I have added Windows Vista and Ubuntu 8.04 on AMD64 to my testing
  routine. The apartment is really starting to look ridiculous,
  and dinner guests probably won't be happening this Summer.

[ features/changes/fixes ]

+ With any luck we may have fixed the long-standing bug that prevents
  Processing from running on non-English systems with user accounts
  that contain non-ASCII characters. This is the target
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49
  However this has not yet been verified. Please test!

+ Apply two patches for ancient bugs in readBytesUntil() and bufferUntil()
  in the serial library. Also fixes calls to serialEvent().
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=96
  (Thanks to stendahl and jmuhlich for the patches!)

+ Added a static version of loadBytes() that reads from a File object.

+ Slightly clearer error messages when OpenGL stuff is missing.

+ Removed sketchbook.fallback and settings.fallback from preferences.
  These cause more confusion/chaos/trouble than necessary.

+ Avoid an occasional division by zero when using the Create Font tool.

ABOUT REV 0139 - 4 June 2008

Stuck on a couple larger problems, this is an interim release to
patch up some problems in the 0136+ series. If this is the first
release you've downloaded since 0135, please read the "ABOUT 013X"
sections for each of the releases since.

[ mixed bag of fixes ]

+ Highlighting of syntax errors was broken.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=795

+ The getIntAttribute() method from the XML library was
  returning a float instead of an int.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=790

+ Include memory settings from preferences when exporting
  a Mac OS X application.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=803

+ Updated to a newer version of Quaqua (OS X lib for GUI)
  http://www.randelshofer.ch/quaqua/

[ top priorities (not fixed) ]

+ "Target VM failed to initialize: VM initialization failed" on run
  This happens because Java is not properly getting the machine's
  internet address. Workaround is to shut off networking:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=796

+ Slow response on file/sketchbook/examples menus on OS X 10.5.
  There appears to be an Apple bug in Java 1.5 and 1.6 on
  Mac OS X 10.5 (but not 10.4) causing these menus to be extremely
  slow. Workarounds described in the bug report:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786

+ Sometimes, nothing happens when you hit Run (no error displayed)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=775

ABOUT REV 0138 - 31 May 2008

Continuing on the > 0135 crazy train.

[ regression repair ]

+ This fixes a major regression since 0135 where code would only run
  from the first sketch window opened.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=784

+ Fix "expecting EOF, found ..." error when importing a library.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=788

+ Remove debug spew when Export is used.

+ Switched to use Java 1.5 (not 1.5 or 1.6) for Processing.app
  on Mac OS X. Hopefully this may avoid additional quirkiness.

[ graphics fix ]

+ Fix tessellation problems with concave 3D geometry that has many
  nearby points (e.g. filled bezier polygons like fonts).
  Upgrade values to doubles, and multiply by 10 so that we can have
  some better accuracy as we tessellate. This seems to have negligible
  speed differences on Windows and Intel Macs, but causes a 50% speed
  drop for PPC Macs with the bug's example code that draws ~200 points
  in a concave polygon. Apple has abandoned PPC so we may as well too.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=774

[ fixed earlier ]

+ The code folder was being ignored on export to application.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=469
  Fixed along with the changes in 0137.

[ new known issues ]

+ Slow response on file, sketchbook, and examples menus
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786
  This may be limited to Mac OS X. The problem is more or less
  known, just need to get a workaround in.

ABOUT REV 0137 - 30 May 2008

This release is an addendum to 0136, please read the notes on that
version if you have not already.

To be clear, we're moving to Java 1.5 for everything: the Processing
environment and for sketches created with it. We don't have enough
people to support it, and for a project of our size, we should be
focusing on the future, rather than working around legacy Java code.
In addition, Java 1.5 gives us access to better timing facilities
which will improve the steadiness of animation.

The "expert" version for Windows has been discontinued temporarily,
while we work out issues with the new runner setup. It may return
for a future release, but require a full JDK download, instead of
just JRE as in the past.

[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix classpath problem with processing.exe. This was a
  major flaw in 0136 prevented applications from running.
  Not sure how this one made it out of Quality Control.
  Today I'm gonna have to fire the guy who runs the
  Processing Release Testing And Quality Assurance Center.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=780

+ Huge jar files when exporting with a code folder.
  (Huge like the PDE trying to zip up everything on your disk.)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=541
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=701
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=714

+ Fix support for the "synchronized" keyword in the preprocessor.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=136

[ changes ]

+ Use multiple JAR files whenever
  1) a lib is in use, 2) code folder, 3) multiple files
  This will prevent MANIFEST collisions, especially when used
  with the code folder.

+ Removed oro.jar dependency (not needed with PApplet.match())

+ Added improvements to the linux startup script contributed
  by forum user 'neitsch'. (Thanks neitsch!)
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=os_core_pde;action=display;num=1202689238

+ Update preferences.txt whenever opening sketches. If you have
  to forcibly quit the application (as a certain P5 developer often
  does), it will at least remember which sketches were running.

+ The openStream() method has been renamed to createInput(), and
  openStream() itself has been deprecated. This was actually done
  in 0136. In addition, a createOutput() method has been added
  that creates an OutputStream.

ABOUT REV 0136 - 29 May 2008

This release represents the first of a set of major (internal)
changes as we head to release 1.0 at the end of the Summer.
This release will not be made the default download, but please
test the release for problems on your platform, and file bugs
(dev.processing.org/bugs) when you find them.

[ major changes, please read ]

+ New Runner
  The most significant change in this release is the introduction
  of a new runner system. This means that we'll be able to make the
  stop button behave properly, shut down sketches correctly, have
  better error handling, and eventually add debugger support.
  On the downside, sketches may start a little more slowly, and it
  may be a bumpy transition as we get things working (strange errors
  when you hit Run).

+ Switching to Java 1.5
  We are moving to Java 1.5 as a minimum requirement for running
  Processing, as well as sketches created with it. This is an
  attempt at self-preservation as we try to limit the number of
  platforms that we support. Note, however that we *still do not*
  support Java 1.5 language extensions (enum, enhanced for loop,
  generics, etc.) More info about that can be found here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=598
  If you find places in the code or reference that refer to Java
  1.4 support, please let us know via dev.processing.org/bugs.

+ New XML Library
  We've switched to NanoXML instead of NanoXML-Lite. This means that
  the export size of the XML library has changed from ~6k to ~30k.
  The new version is much better at handling a broader range of XML
  content. The API should be the same and your code should work
  without changes (unless you're playing with namespaces, in which
  case those have to be specified differently).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=757

+ Changes to how libraries are found
  Major bug fixing happened in handling the class path issues and
  dealing with how libraries are loaded. With any luck, this should
  fix the dreaded aiexport bug. It should also give better results
  when multiple libraries are installed on the system. However, it
  may mean that some libraries (or jarfiles) that shouldn't have
  been working before will now (properly) no longer work.


[ minor enhancements ]

+ curveTangent() implemented by Dave Bollinger. (Thank you!)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=715

+ Added support for quadratic (as opposed to just cubic) curves to
  the Candy SVG library.

+ Altered Processing.app on Mac OS X to use the Quartz rendering
  engine. In OS X 10.5, Apple switched renderers, which made most
  Processing sketches run considerably slower. Thanks Apple!

+ Added ctrl-/ to comment a block of code

+ Minor change to default window dimensions to support the Eee PC

+ Updated reference and slight reorganization to fix a handful of
  broken links. Moved the FAQ to the Processing site (no longer
  included in the download.)

+ Added a static version of saveStream() that uses a File object.

+ Add XMLElement (not filename) constructor to SVG lib
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=773


[ bug fixes ]

+ Color selector fixed by Francis Li. (Thanks!)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=656
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=584

+ Net library no longer dies unceremoniously on "Connection Refused"
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=751

+ Space after OPENGL param no longer breaks export
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=769

+ Fix "noLoop()" sketches unresponsive to exit request
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=694

+ Fixed bug with subset() when no length parameter was specified
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=707

+ Retired the long-standing TIFF in After Effects bug
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=153

+ Fix for bezierTangent() problem from Dave Bollinger (Thanks!)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=710

+ Fix problem with get() when imageMode(CORNERS) was in use

+ Fix bug with splice() and arrays
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=734

+ PImage mask now works after first call
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=744

+ Fix upside-down TGA files
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=742

+ Fix problem with g.smooth always returning false in JAVA2D
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=762


[ known new problems ]

+ With the new runner setup, sketches sometimes won't start every
  ~10th time or so (this will vary depending on your machine).
  Hitting Run again should make things start up.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=775
  This may actually be a problem with Mac OS X sometimes not
  launching Java. More recent Java releases for Mac OS X have
  become less stable. If you see this on Windows, please let us
  know at the bug report.
