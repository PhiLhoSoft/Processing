# I voluntarily leave here an inconsistency in French, to illustrate some translation issues
# that people not knowing the language might overlook:
# in English, we write 'in France', 'in Quebec', etc.
# in French, we write 'en France', 'au Québec' (au Yémen, aux États-Unis, etc.)
# So sometime code must be improved to handle linguistic peculiarities
# I suppose here that FR, EN, etc. can have a generic usage, so including the word in the country name is not an option...
# Same issue with country gender... Yes, we have genders and number, plus elisions for countries names in French,
# how strange! For example: la France, l'Espagne, le Japon, les États-Unis...
# I18n isn't a simple problem! :-)
FR = Québec (Canada)
