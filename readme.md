Processing
==========

All my work in Processing: http://Processing.org

*_3rdPartyHelp* are sketches from somebody else, which I helped to improve (in the forum).

*_JBox2D* is to play with this library and to make a tutorial on it.

*_QuickExperiments* is to make... quick experiments, small sketches.

*_SmallPrograms* is for more ambitious sketches.

*Other folders* are mostly history, old small programs too.

I recently (Nov 2014) converted the repository from Bazaar to Git, moving it online from Launchpad to GitHub.
