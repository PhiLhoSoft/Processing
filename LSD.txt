Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees
And marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, a girl with
Kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, towering over you head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah. ah
Follow her down to a bridge by a mountain where rocking horse
People eat marshmallow pies. Ev'ry one smiles as you drift
Past the flowers that grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with you head in the clouds,
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah. ah

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Lucy In the sky with diamonds. Ah ah
